# Robot-aided Human Evacuation Optimal Path Planning for Fire Drill in Buildings

## Project Overview
This repository contains the research and code for an innovative project aimed at improving the efficiency and safety of evacuations in high-rise buildings during emergencies using autonomous robots. The primary focus is to utilize robotics to reduce the need for human intervention by optimizing evacuation routes using advanced computational methods.

## Abstract
Evacuating people in emergencies from high-rise buildings poses significant risks and must be executed as swiftly as possible. With advancements in robotics, autonomous robots can play a crucial role in such scenarios, though challenges remain in determining optimal routes to exits. This project introduces a method for safely guiding individuals during emergencies using autonomous robots. We employ the Moving Target TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem), a modified approach designed to account for human movement, optimizing the robot's navigation towards the nearest emergency exits, such as staircases. The solution leverages a genetic algorithm to refine the evacuation path, significantly reducing the robot's travel distance compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of this approach has been validated through comprehensive simulations.

## Key Features
